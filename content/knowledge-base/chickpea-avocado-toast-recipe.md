  - question: Are Any Side Effects To Eating Chickpea Avocado Toast?
    answer: >-
      Chickpea avocado toast is a popular dish made by mashing avocado and
      spreading it on top of toast, often with additional toppings like herbs,
      spices, or cheese. While this healthy dish is generally safe to eat, there
      are a few potential side effects to be aware of.


      For one, chickpeas and avocados are both high in fiber. Eating too much fiber can lead to digestive issues like gas, bloating, and constipation. If you experience any of these symptoms after eating chickpea avocado toast, try reducing the amount of each ingredient you use or add more liquid (water or broth) to your meal to help soften the AVOCADO impact.


      In addition, those with allergies to legumes (including chickpeas) or tree fruits (like avocados) should avoid this dish. If you’re not sure if you have an allergy to either of these ingredients, it’s best to speak with a doctor or allergist before consuming chickpea avocado toast.
